# Bank-Loan-Classification-Prediction
In this project, I explored a dataset to predict personal loan acceptance. I employed feature engineering techniques and implemented machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes (ComplementNB, MultinomialNB). The goal was to achieve individual's likelihood of accepting a personal loan offer from the bank.
